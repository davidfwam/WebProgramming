Ingredients
2 packages (14.1 ounces each) refrigerated pie pastry
1 cup butter, softened
2-1/2 cups sugar
4 large eggs
1/2 cup Key lime juice
2 cups all-purpose flour
1-1/2 cups self-rising flour
1-1/2 cups buttermilk
FROSTING:
12 ounces cream cheese, softened
1-1/2 cups butter, softened
1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2-3/4 to 3 cups confectioners' sugar
6 tablespoons Key lime juice
Fresh raspberries


Directions
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line 32 muffin cups with foil liners. On a lightly floured work surface, unroll pastry sheets. Cut 32 circles with a floured 2-1/4-in. round cookie cutter (discard remaining pastry or save for another use). Press one pastry circle into each liner. Bake 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar until crumbly. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in lime juice. In another bowl, whisk flours; add to butter mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating well after each addition.
Pour batter into prepared cups. Bake 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, butter and vanilla until blended. Beat in enough confectioners' sugar, alternately with lime juice, to reach desired consistency. Frost cupcakes; top with raspberries. Refrigerate leftovers.
Editor's Note: As a substitute for 1-1/2 cups self-rising flour, place 2-1/4 teaspoons baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a measuring cup. Add all-purpose flour to measure 1 cup. Combine with an additional 1/2 cup all-purpose flour.
