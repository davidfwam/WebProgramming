<h1>Formatting text</h1>
<h2>Paragraphs and Line Breaks</h2>
Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way
that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a meansof marking
up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. <p> Formatting text to
appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear </p> in a printed document.
